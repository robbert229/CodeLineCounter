Dear Github,

This is originally just a java assignment for a command line code line counter
application. I had some free time and it had been a while since I had worked
with swing (I wonder why...) so I decided that I would overkill it and make a
full on gui application to do it. When talking with some class mates I kept 
on hearing convoluted ideas on how to deal with certain edge cases and make 
sure that you properly counted all the lines of code. Instead of worrying 
about all that I just used a regular expression to strip all the comments from 
the code, more regex to remove empty lines, and then just counted my remaining 
lines. It was that simple, and so I decided to post it to gh so that my account
will show some more activity, since I don't use it enough. If this is the 
grader reading I did infact do the extracredit of counting the lines of code
in subdirectories, it was too simple not to.
